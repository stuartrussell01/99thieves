	  <h2>Our Beginnings</h2>
	  	<p>Founded in January of 2020 in the city of Los Angeles. From the beginning, the aim of 99 Thieves was to supply high quality clothing with interesting designs to the public eye and tap into the "hypebeast" culture.</p>
		
		<p> With the growth of the apparel design market in recent years, not tapping into the market would be stupid, so we took our chances and created an affordable option for hypebeasts, designers and the common dude to break into the fashion scene.</p>
		
		<p>After handing out some clothing to celebrities and influencers, the brand started to gain traction, with investors and fashionistas making orders and putting money into the brand. Over time, more celebrities were spotted wearing the branding, people asked questions and we opened up our doors for business, offering delivery to 30 states in the U.S.A. With goals to extend our reach across the states as well as the world, making the product more accessible.</p>
		<br>
		<br>
	
	 <h2>Our Brand</h2>
		<p>Our name is a reflection of our prices, with our customers remarking "Prices are so good, it's a steal." Read between the lines here. Also the name just sounded cool, 99 refers to the song "99 Red Balloons" by Nena, released in the 80's.</p>
		
		<p>All of our designs are currently created by a single designer, with his goal being to set 99 Thieves on the market as a recognisable and establish brand, providing interesting designs that the consumers will enjoy wearing.</p>
		
		<p>We wanted to stray away from the over done simple text designs you see on most modern designs, we find it very boring and overdone. So we've went for a more rustic approach, with printed design in a cartoon design scheme.</p>
		<br>
		<br>
		
	<h2>We, The People</h2>
		<p>99 Thieves is run by a small group of people. With our lead creative director and CEO being the forefather of the company. Starting from a basement in suburban Maryland, Andrew had a dream to create and see his creation grow on social media as well as in the streets of the US. From printing his first designs in 2019, to distributing across the planet. Andrew's leadership and creative brain led his brand to become a established one in the streetwear world, with rappers and influencers rocking 99T on the daily.</p>
		
		<p>The team has expanded, with a 99 Thieves compound for the production and distribution of our merch and products, expanding into not only apparel, but also into the world of merchandising and eventually jewellery.</p>
